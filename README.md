Transfer learning uses pre-trained models from one machine learning task or dataset to improve performance and generalizability on a related task or dataset.

  - Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which knowledge gained through one task or dataset is used to improve model performance on another related task and/or different dataset.1 In other words, transfer learning uses what has been learned in one setting      to improve generalization in another setting
