# Face Recognition System
This is a project Python subject which using model AI to detect face of classmate 

This project uses a technique called transfer learing to trained model insightface

GUI: PyQt

Database: Mysql

Link trained model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19caf9LhCZAH3Sw8BVgGXr2lLwqzvJEyU?usp=sharing

You can download model in my drive and import into the project using keras.load_model because the model is over 100mb so i can not push to my git

Transfer learning uses pre-trained models from one machine learning task or dataset to improve performance and generalizability on a related task or dataset.

  - Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which knowledge gained through one task or dataset is used to improve model performance on another related task and/or different dataset.1 In other words, transfer learning uses what has been learned in one setting      to improve generalization in another setting
